# Blindness Detection AI Model

This repository contains code for training an AI model to detect blindness using PyTorch. The model is a simple example and uses randomly generated data for demonstration purposes. In practice, you would replace the random data with real medical images and labels.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch (install using `pip install torch`)
- Matplotlib (install using `pip install matplotlib`)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
- `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blindness-detection.git`

2. Change into the project directory:

- `cd Golden-project-1`
3. Install the required Python packages:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Usage
Use Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization.
#Training
- Run the training script:
`python Blindness_detection.py`

## Model Evaluation

- **Training Loss**: The training loss indicates how well the model learned from the random data. It may decrease during training.

- **Training Accuracy**: The training accuracy is calculated based on the random data labels and model predictions during training. It may increase but is not indicative of real-world performance.

- **Validation Loss**: The validation loss is calculated on a portion of the random data held out for validation. It gives an idea of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

- **Validation Accuracy**: The validation accuracy is computed on the validation set, similar to training accuracy.
