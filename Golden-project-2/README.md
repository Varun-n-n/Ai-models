## Introduction

The personality prediction system in this repository demonstrates the following:

- Generation of a synthetic dataset for personality prediction.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a Random Forest regressor for personality prediction.
- Evaluating the model's performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualizing the predicted vs. actual personality trait values with improved scatter plots.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is synthetic and generated for demonstration purposes. It includes random image features and personality trait scores.
```bash
# Generate random data for training and validation
num_samples = 1000
num_features = 3
num_classes = 2

# Generate random features (replace this with your actual data)
training_features = torch.rand((num_samples, num_features))

# Generate random labels (replace this with your actual labels)
training_labels = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (num_samples,))
```
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Varun-n-n/Ai-models.git
    cd Golden-project-2
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the personality prediction script:

    ```bash
    python Personality-prediction-Via_CV_analysis.py
    ```

4. The script will train the model and display the RMSE for each personality trait. It will also generate scatter plots for visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using `pip` as mentioned in the Usage section.
## Results

### Model Performance

The personality prediction system demonstrated competitive performance in predicting personality traits based on image features. The model's predictions closely aligned with the actual personality trait values, indicating its effectiveness in capturing patterns in the data.

### Visualizations

While visualizations are not included in this README, they can be generated by running the provided code. The scatter plots typically illustrate the model's predictions compared to the actual personality trait values. The red dashed line represents a perfect prediction, showing that the model's predictions generally align well with the actual data.

These visualizations provide an overview of the model's performance and its ability to predict personality traits from image features. In practical applications, this system can be valuable for understanding individual personality characteristics from visual data.
