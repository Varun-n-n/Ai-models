# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting house prices using a Random Forest Regressor model. The code generates a synthetic dataset for house price prediction, trains the model, and evaluates its performance. It also includes hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model for better predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Varun-n-n/Ai-models.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   `cd Task-1`

3. Run the Python script:
   
  `python House_price_prediction.py`

## Usage

- `House_price_prediction.py` contains the main Python script for generating the synthetic dataset, training the Random Forest Regressor model, and evaluating its performance.

## Results

After running the script, you will see the following results:

- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-squared (R2)

A scatterplot will also be displayed, showing the actual vs. predicted house prices.
