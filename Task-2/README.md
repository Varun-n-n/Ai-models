# Gold Price Prediction

This project aims to predict gold prices using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on synthetic data for demonstration purposes, and it uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor with epsilon-insensitive loss to handle outliers. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the predictions.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get started with this project.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required packages using `pip`:
- `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`

## Installation
Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Varun-n-n/Ai-models.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd Task-2`
## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the gold price prediction model.

`python Gold_price_prediction.py`

View the evaluation metrics and the visualization of predicted vs. actual gold prices.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
You can find the evaluation results in the console output when you run the script.
Additionally, a graph comparing actual and predicted gold prices is displayed for visualization.
